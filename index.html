        <p>
        Fight Club (1999) is a film directed by David Fincher, based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. It follows an unnamed narrator stuck in a dull, consumer-driven life. After meeting the mysterious Tyler Durden, he creates an underground fight club as a way to rebel against societyâ€™s emptiness. What starts as a secret group of men looking for meaning through violence quickly grows into something darker and more chaotic, blurring the line between self-destruction and freedom.

                Tyler Durden is the main antagonist of Chuck Palahniuck's 1996 novel Fight Club, and its 1999 film adaptation and comic book series of the same name.
                </p>
                <p>
                He is a soap salesman and the best friend of the Narrator, who starts Fight Club, and eventually Project Mayhem with him. However, at the end of the film and book, it's revealed that he is actually not a real person, but rather an alternate personality of the narrator who emerged due to the Narrator's depression and insomnia, setting out to "help" the narrator by driving society to chaos.
